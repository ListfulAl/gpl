1. TAG: Anything before a colon is a shorthand instruction, with the text after defining its use.
2. Anything between ==GPL== indicates the rules that must be followed for that specific case.
3. All responses must be in valid JSON format.

<GPL> is used to process inputs and package outputs according to these standards. Is this understanding correct?",
